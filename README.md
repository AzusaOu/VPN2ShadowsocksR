## Why
  As we know, there isn't an appropriate SSR client on IOS devices(current SSR clients such as Wingy are lack of protocols, especially the protocol 'auth_aes128_md5' which @breakwa11 recommended). However, VPN with IKEv2 protocol is avliable. Thus an idea came out that we can access SSR server via IKEv2.
